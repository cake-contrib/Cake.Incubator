# Contributing

This is very much an active project so any and all contributions are welcome, even just finding issues!

## Reporting issues

All issues should be tracked on [GitHub](https://github.com/cake-contrib/Cake.Incubator), with enough information to reproduce the issue.

## Code Contributions

This repository is based around the Git Flow workflow, using feature branches and pull requests to manage incoming changes and fixes. Generally speaking you can follow the same guidance as Cake itself (found [here](http://cakebuild.net/docs/contributing/guidelines)), which can be summarised as follows:

- Find a change or fix you want to implement
- Fork the repo
- Create a new branch named `feature/<your-feature-name>` and make your changes
- Open a PR from your feature branch against the `develop` branch (include the GitHub issue number for fixes)
- Success! I will provide feedback if needed, or just accept the changes directly and they should appear in the next release
